The Garden is for example can be addeding stuff to the wiki the Gun Control articles, building out a network of often conflicting information into a web that can generate insights, iterating it, allowing that to grow into something bigger than a single event, a single narrative, or single meaning. To use a post-modern turn of phrase, the Stream is Inhospitable to strangers. If the Garden is exposition, the stream is conversation and rhetoric, for better and worse. On the world wide web of course, only an author gets to determine links. On the web, if you wanted to read something you had to read it on someone else's server where you couldn't rewrite it, and you couldn't annotate it, you couldn't copy it, and you couldn't add links to it, you couldn't curate it.

A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages.

However, the need for unified catalogues only emerged after World Wars One and Two, and the computerization of the catalogue facilitated the dissemination of knowledge through online access.
