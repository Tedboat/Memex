### Summary & Key Take Aways
Media historian [Lisa Gitelman](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/lisa-gitelman.html)'s research focuses on American print culture, inscriptional methods, and the new media of the past and present. This article examines how media, particularly new media, are experienced and studied as historical subjects. She uses the World Wide Web as an example because it is a crucial example or application of what are now often and collectively referred to as new media, which were new between 1878 and 1910. She argues that new media depends intricately on the social context within which production and consumption are defined as distinct rather than merely on producers and consumers themselves.
