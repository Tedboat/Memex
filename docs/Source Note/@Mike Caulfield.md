### Summary & Key Take Aways
There are two terms representing different approaches to the Web: The Garden and the Stream.The web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another. Things in the Garden don't collapse to a single set of relations or canonical sequence, and that's part of what we mean when we say "The web as topology" or the "Web as space". The Garden is for example can be addeding stuff to the wiki the Gun Control articles, building out a network of often conflicting information into a web that can generate insights, iterating it, allowing that to grow into something bigger than a single event, a single narrative, or single meaning. To use a post-modern turn of phrase, the Stream is Inhospitable to strangers. If the Garden is exposition, the stream is conversation and rhetoric, for better and worse. On the world wide web of course, only an author gets to determine links. On the web, if you wanted to read something you had to read it on someone else's server where you couldn't rewrite it, and you couldn't annotate it, you couldn't copy it, and you couldn't add links to it, you couldn't curate it. A web where where links are used to create a conversational trail instead of associations of ideas.
